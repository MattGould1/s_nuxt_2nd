### Guidelines

## Features

- name features distinctively
- names can be found in three different casings:
  - dash-case in store filename: example-feature
  - UpperCamelCase in containers: ExampleFeature
  - lowerCamelCase in store instance: exampleFeatureStore

## Data fetcher

- can be called only from containers
